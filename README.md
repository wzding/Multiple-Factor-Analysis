# An R package for Multiple Factor Analysis

The goal of the project is to create an R package that implements Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA).
This package also include unit tests, vignettes and a shiny app. Html slides are also created for a 
presentation (e.g. a tutorial or seminar) about MFA, and the package.
